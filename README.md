CNN is a Neural network that is used for image classification.<br/>
Here I have used MNIST Hand written digits dataset.<br/><br/>
![dataset](https://github.com/parasgulati/Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-/blob/master/we.jpg)
<br/>It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images each of 28 x 28 dimensions represented by pixel matirx.
<br/>The model of cnn is shown<br/> 
there are various layers.It recognises digits image with an accuracy of 97.58 %
